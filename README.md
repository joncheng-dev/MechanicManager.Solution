## Setup/Installation Requirements

### Required Technology

- _Verify that you have the required technology installed for MySQL (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) and MySQL Workbench (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/)._

### Setting Up the Project

_2. Navigate to where you want to place the cloned directory._

_3. Clone the repository from the GitHub link by entering in this command:_

> ```bash
> $ git clone https://github.com/joncheng-dev/MechanicManager.Solution
> ```

_4. Navigate to the project's production directory `Factory`, and create a new file called `appsettings.json`._

_5. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid`, and `pwd` values with your username and password for MySQL._

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=mechanic_manager_db;uid=[YOUR-USERNAME-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
}
```

## Running the Project

> ```bash
> $ dotnet watch run
> ```

- _Alternatively, using the command `dotnet run` will execute the application. Manually open a browser window and navigate to the application url (ex: `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`)_

> ```bash
> $ dotnet run
> ```

- _Optionally, to compile this web app without running it, enter:_
